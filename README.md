# Rosalinda_tasks
My personal solutions for tasks on Rosalind (rosalind.info). Link to my profile: https://rosalind.info/users/Va01007/


Hello everyone, here I am sharing my solutions to problems from the Rosalind website in open access. The scripts are primarily written in Python. When using third-party libraries, they will be indicated with a special note "#Non_base_library: link_to_download". The tasks are named according to their titles on the website. In the folder, you will find documents with input data in the Sample folder. The solutions will be sorted in the order I completed them and by folders corresponding to the sections. Please do not use these scripts as ready-made solutions; remember that your skills and abilities are what matter most!

Here are a few small notes that will be used in comments at the beginning of each script:
/ - task not completed, and you have only a draft of the script
// - task successfully completed

I will also provide some of the scripts with my comments. Enjoy!
